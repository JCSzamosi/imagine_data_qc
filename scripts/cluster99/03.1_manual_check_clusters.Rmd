Manually check the 99% clustering
=================================

## Setup

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Import Data

```{r}
asvtab = readRDS('data/merged_seqtab.rds')
load('intermed/clsts/Rdata')
```

### Look at the clusters

```{r}
head(clsts)
	# Each sequence has its own row, in the order they were originally listed in
	# The cluster number that each sequence belongs to is listed in its row in
	# the "cluster" column

# Count the clusters
n_distinct(clsts$cluster)

# Count the number of clusters of each size
clsts %>% count(cluster, name = 'size') %>% count(size, name = 'count') %>%
    arrange(desc(size))
```
